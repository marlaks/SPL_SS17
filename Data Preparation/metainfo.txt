Description:       'Prepares Data for modeling phase. Encodes outcome variable to 1 and 0. Creates only numeric version of Dataset through Dummy variables.
                   creates two different versions from this through z-score normalization and min-max-scaling. Creates test and train
                   sets for each dataset. Oversamples the YES class of the outcome variable with SMOTE algorithm. Plots the new distributions
                   of the outcome variable.'
 
Keywords:          Data preparation, Dummy encoding, z-score, min-max-scaling, SMOTE
